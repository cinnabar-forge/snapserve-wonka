## Getting Started

### Installation

Install SnapServe globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g snapserve
```

To access global plugins (`snapserve-*`), use `export NODE_PATH=$(npm root -g)`. To make the `NODE_PATH` setting permanent for Node.js, you can add it to your user's profile configuration file. This file is typically `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.zshrc`, depending on which shell you are using.

### Usage
